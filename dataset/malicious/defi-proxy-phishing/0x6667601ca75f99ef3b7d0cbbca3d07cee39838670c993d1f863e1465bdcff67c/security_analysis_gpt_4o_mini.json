The gas usage is minimal, indicating that the transaction may not be fully executed or is designed to be efficient in a suspicious manner.",
  "recommendations": [
    "Conduct a deeper analysis of the JavaScript code for potential vulnerabilities.",
    "Monitor the transaction hash for any future activity related to the malicious contract address.",
