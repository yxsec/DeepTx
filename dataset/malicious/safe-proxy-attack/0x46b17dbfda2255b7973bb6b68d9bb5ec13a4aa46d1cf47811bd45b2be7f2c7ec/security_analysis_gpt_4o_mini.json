      "weight": 0.4,
      "reasoning": "Gas efficiency is important for understanding transaction cost and potential abuse. The gas usage is relatively low, indicating normal behavior, hence a moderate weight."

      "weight": 0.2,
      "reasoning": "UI/JavaScript security indicators can reveal potential vulnerabilities. Although there is JavaScript present, it does not indicate malicious intent, so this category is weighted lower."

    "Monitor for future transactions from this address to identify any patterns.",
    "Conduct regular audits of JavaScript code for potential vulnerabilities.",
